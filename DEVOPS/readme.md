- **Agentless**: No need to install any agents on the managed nodes; uses SSH for communication.
- **Idempotent**: Ensures tasks are only executed when changes are necessary, preventing unnecessary modifications.
- **Modular**: Extensible through modules and plugins, which can be written in various languages.
- **Declarative**: Describes the desired state of the system, rather than the steps to achieve it.

### Installation
Ansible can be installed on various platforms via package managers, pip, or as a standalone application.

#### Using pip
```sh
pip install ansible
```

#### Using Package Managers
- **Ubuntu/Debian**
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ansible
  ```

- **Red Hat/CentOS**
  ```sh
  sudo yum install epel-release
  sudo yum install ansible
  ```

### Basic Configuration
1. **Inventory**: Defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks will operate.
   ```ini
   [webservers]
   web1.example.com
   web2.example.com

   [databases]
   db1.example.com
   ```

2. **Playbook**: Defines a list of tasks to be executed on the managed nodes, written in YAML.
   ```yaml
   - name: Install and configure web server
     hosts: webservers
     tasks:
       - name: Install Apache
         apt:
           name: apache2
           state: present

       - name: Start Apache
         service:
           name: apache2
           state: started
           enabled: yes
   ```

### Example Playbook
```yaml
- name: Setup and deploy web application
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install necessary packages
      apt:
        name:
          - apache2
          - git
        state: present

    - name: Clone repository
      git:
        repo: 'https://github.com/example/repo.git'
        dest: /var/www/html/repo

    - name: Configure Apache
      copy:
        src: /path/to/httpd.conf
        dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

### Using Ansible Modules
Ansible modules are units of code that perform specific tasks. Modules can be used to install packages, manage services, handle files, and more.

#### Example of Common Modules
- **Package Management**
  ```yaml
  - name: Install nginx
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
  ```

  ```yaml
  - name: Create a directory
    file:
      path: /etc/my_app
      state: directory
      mode: '0755'
  ```

### Roles
Roles are a way to organize playbooks and reusable sets of tasks. A role has a specific directory structure and can include variables, tasks, files, templates, and more.

#### Example Role Structure
```sh
my_role/
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── files
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│   └── main.yml
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
├── templates
├── tests

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install puppet-agent
  ```

- **Red Hat/CentOS**
  ```sh
  sudo rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet7-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
  sudo yum install puppet-agent
  ```

### Basic Configuration
1. **Puppet Manifest**: Puppet manifests are files written in Puppet's DSL and have a `.pp` extension. They describe the desired state of the system.
   ```puppet
   node default {
     package { 'httpd':
       ensure => installed,
     }

     service { 'httpd':
       ensure => running,
       enable => true,
     }

     file { '/var/www/html/index.html':
       ensure  => file,
       content => '<h1>Welcome to Puppet!</h1>',
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Puppet Master and Agent**: In a Puppet deployment, the Puppet master server manages configurations, and Puppet agents apply those configurations on managed nodes.

### Example Manifest
```puppet
node 'webserver' {
  class { 'apache':
    docroot => '/var/www/html',
  }

  file { '/var/www/html/index.html':
    ensure  => file,
    content => '<h1>Welcome to Puppet-managed Apache server!</h1>',
  }
}

class apache {
  package { 'httpd':
    ensure => installed,
  }

  service { 'httpd':
    ensure => running,
    enable => true,
  }

  file { '/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf':
    ensure  => file,
    source  => 'puppet:///modules/apache/httpd.conf',
    require => Package['httpd'],
  }
}
```

### Puppet Modules
Modules are reusable, shareable units of Puppet code. They can be used to manage specific resources or configurations.

#### Example Module Structure
```sh
my_module/
├── manifests
│   └── init.pp
├── files
│   └── httpd.conf
├── templates
│   └── httpd.conf.erb
├── examples
│   └── init.pp
└── tests
    └── init.pp
```

2. **Recipes**: Recipes are the primary components of cookbooks, specifying the resources and configurations to be applied to nodes.
   ```ruby
   package 'httpd'

   service 'httpd' do
     action [:enable, :start]
   end

   file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
     content '<h1>Welcome to Chef!</h1>'
     mode '0755'
     owner 'root'
     group 'root'
   end
   ```

3. **Nodes**: Nodes are any server or device managed by Chef. They can be physical, virtual, cloud, or network devices.

### Example Cookbook
#### Directory Structure
```sh
my_cookbook/
├── recipes
│   └── default.rb
├── attributes
├── files
│   └── default
├── templates
│   └── default
├── libraries
├── resources
├── providers
└── metadata.rb
```

#### Default Recipe (`recipes/default.rb`)
```ruby
package 'httpd'

service 'httpd' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end

template '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  source 'index.html.erb'
  mode '0644'
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
end
```

#### Template (`templates/default/index.html.erb`)
```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Welcome to Chef</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Chef-managed Apache server!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Using Chef Server
Chef Server acts as a hub for configuration data. Chef Clients connect to the Chef Server to retrieve the necessary configurations and apply them.

1. **Install Chef Server**: Follow the installation instructions on the [Chef Server Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/server/install_server/).
2. **Configure Workstation**: Install ChefDK on your workstation and configure it to communicate with the Chef Server.
   ```sh
   knife configure
   ```

3. **Bootstrap Nodes**: Use Knife to bootstrap nodes, installing the Chef Client and configuring them to communicate with the Chef Server.
   ```sh
   knife bootstrap <node_address> -x <username> -P <password> --node-name <node_name>
   ```

### Best Practices

### Basic Configuration
1. **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.
   ```Dockerfile
   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:3.8-slim

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
   COPY . /app

   # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
   EXPOSE 80

   # Define environment variable
   ENV NAME World

   # Run app.py when the container launches
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
   ```yaml
   version: '3'

   services:
     web:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       volumes:
         - .:/code
       environment:
         FLASK_ENV: development
     redis:
       image: "redis:alpine"
   ```

### Example Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install any needed packages
RUN npm install

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . .

# Make port 3000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 3000

# Define environment variable
ENV NODE_ENV production

# Run app.js when the container launches
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Using Docker Commands
- **Build an image**:
  ```sh
  docker build -t myapp .
  ```

- **Run a container**:
  ```sh
  docker run -p 4000:80 myapp
  ```

- **List running containers**:
  ```sh
  docker ps
  ```

- **Stop a container**:
  ```sh
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```

- **Remove a container**:
  ```sh
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

### Using Docker Compose
Docker Compose simplifies the process of running multi-container applications.

- **Start services**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```

- **Stop services**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **List services**:
  ```sh
  docker-compose ps
  ```

### Best Practices
- **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Optimize your Docker images by using multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
- **Minimize Layers**: Combine commands to reduce the number of layers in your images.
- **Use .dockerignore**: Exclude unnecessary files from the build context to keep images smaller.
- **Run as Non-Root User**: Configure your containers to run as a non-root user for security reasons.

## Kubernetes

### Overview
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

### Key Features
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Automatically roll out changes to your application or its configuration, and rollback if something goes wrong.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address and load-balance traffic across them.
- **Storage Orchestration**: Automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider, or a network storage system.
- **Self-Healing**: Restart containers that fail, replace and reschedule containers when nodes die, and kill containers that don’t respond to user-defined health checks.
- **Secret and Configuration Management**: Deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.

### Installation
Kubernetes can be installed on various platforms using different tools like kubeadm, Minikube, and k3s for local setups, or managed services like GKE, EKS, and AKS for production-grade environments.

#### Using Minikube (Local Setup)
Minikube is a tool that sets up a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.
```sh
# Install Minikube
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# Start Minikube
minikube start

# Verify Installation
kubectl get nodes
```

### Basic Configuration
1. **Pods**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: myapp-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: myapp-container
       image: myapp:1.0
       ports:
       - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. **Deployments**: A Deployment provides declarative updates to applications.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp-container
           image: myapp:1.0
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

3. **Services**: A Service exposes a set of Pods as a network service.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: myapp-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: myapp
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

### Example Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp-container
        image: myapp:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### Service (`myapp-service.yaml`)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Using kubectl Commands
- **Apply configuration**:
  ```sh
  kubectl apply -f myapp-deployment.yaml
  kubectl apply -f myapp-service.yaml
  ```

- **Get status**:
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods
  kubectl get services
  kubectl get deployments
  ```

- **Describe resources**:
  ```sh
  kubectl describe pod myapp-pod

## Monitoring


## Prometheus

### Overview
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is particularly well-suited for dynamic cloud environments and provides powerful querying, visualization, and alerting capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Multidimensional Data Model**: Uses metrics identified by metric names and key-value pairs (labels).
- **Flexible Query Language**: PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) for querying and aggregating time series data.
- **Efficient Storage**: Stores time series data efficiently and compactly.
- **Auto-Discovery**: Supports service discovery mechanisms to automatically find targets to scrape.
- **Alerting**: Integrates with Alertmanager to handle alerts and notifications.

### Installation
Prometheus can be installed on various platforms using different methods like binary downloads, Docker, and Kubernetes.

#### Using Docker
```sh
docker run -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

#### Using Kubernetes (Helm)
```sh
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
```

### Basic Configuration
Prometheus is configured via a YAML file (prometheus.yml). This file defines scrape targets, alerting rules, and other settings.

#### prometheus.yml Example
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

### Example Usage
1. **Running Prometheus**
   ```sh
   prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
   ```

2. **Scraping Metrics**
   Prometheus scrapes metrics from HTTP endpoints. Example:
   ```sh
   curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
   ```

3. **Querying Metrics**
   Use Prometheus's web UI or PromQL to query metrics. Example PromQL query to get the rate of HTTP requests:
   ```promql
   rate(http_requests_total[5m])
   ```

### Setting Up Node Exporter
Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics.

#### Using Docker
```sh
docker run -d -p 9100:9100 prom/node-exporter
```

### Alerting with Alertmanager
Prometheus integrates with Alertmanager to handle alerts and notifications.

#### alertmanager.yml Example
```yaml
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m

route:
  receiver: 'email'

receivers:
  - name: 'email'
    email_configs:
      - to: 'you@example.com'
        from: 'prometheus@example.com'
        smarthost: 'smtp.example.com:587'
```

#### Configuring Prometheus to Use Alertmanager
Update `prometheus.yml` to include Alertmanager configuration:
```yaml
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9093']

rule_files:
  - 'alert_rules.yml'
```

#### alert_rules.yml Example
```yaml
groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"} < 20
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage detected"
          description: "CPU usage is above 80% for more than 1 minute."
```

### Best Practices
- **Use Labels Effectively**: Use labels to differentiate between various dimensions of your metrics.
- **Setup Retention Policies**: Configure appropriate data retention policies to manage storage usage.
- **Use Recording Rules**: Precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive expressions.
- **Monitor Prometheus**: Use Prometheus to monitor itself and alert on its own health and performance.
- **Leverage Exporters**: Utilize existing exporters for various services (Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, etc.).
